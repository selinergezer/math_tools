This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C++ that offers a collection of useful mathematical tools and calculators. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily select and perform various mathematical operations through a single interactive menu.

## 🌟 Features

The application provides the following core functionalities, accessible via the main menu:

1.  **Factorial Calculation:** Compute the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
2.  **Prime Number Check:** Determine whether a given integer is a prime number.
3.  **Multiplication Table (Times Table):** Generate the multiplication table for a number up to a specified limit.
4.  **Combinations and Permutations:** Calculate the number of possible combinations and permutations for given total items and selected items values.

5.  **GCD and LCM:** Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers.

6.  **Fibonacci Series:** Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

You need a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) installed on your system.

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/selinergezer/math_tools.git](https://github.com/selinergezer/math_tools.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```
2.  **Compile the source files:**
    Assuming you have separate files like `main.cpp`, `functions.cpp`, and `functions.h`, use a command similar to the following to compile them:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp functions.cpp -o math_tools
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./math_tools
    ```

## 📖 Usage

Upon running the program, the main menu will be displayed:
